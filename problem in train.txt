1. To find the speeds of the trains, let's assume the speed of the slower train is x m/s and the speed of the faster train is y m/s.

When they run in the same direction:
Relative speed = (y - x) m/s
Distance = length of slower train + length of faster train = 125 + 115 = 240 meters
Time = 30 seconds

Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time,
240 = (y - x) × 30

When they run in the opposite direction:
Relative speed = (y + x) m/s
Distance = length of slower train + length of faster train = 125 + 115 = 240 meters
Time = 10 seconds

Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time,
240 = (y + x) × 10

Now we have a system of equations:

240 = 30(y - x)    ---(1)
240 = 10(y + x)    ---(2)

Solving these equations will give us the values of x and y, representing the speeds of the trains.

Let's solve the equations:
From equation (2), we get:
y + x = 24     ---(3)    [dividing both sides by 10]

From equation (1), we get:
y - x = 8     ---(4)    [dividing both sides by 30]

Adding equations (3) and (4):
2y = 32
y = 16

Substituting the value of y in equation (3):
16 + x = 24
x = 8

Therefore, the speeds of the trains are:
Slower train speed = 8 m/s
Faster train speed = 16 m/s

So, the answer is (8, 16).

2. To find the time taken for the trains to cross each other, we can use the concept of relative speed.

The speed of the first train = 50 km/hr = (50 × 5/18) m/s = 250/18 m/s
The speed of the second train = 60 km/hr = (60 × 5/18) m/s = 300/18 m/s

Let's assume the time taken for the trains to cross each other is t seconds.

When two trains move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.

Relative speed = (250/18 + 300/18) m/s = 550/18 m/s

The distance to be covered is the sum of the lengths of the trains.

Distance = length of first train + length of second train = 140 + 166 = 306 meters

Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time,
306 = (550/18) × t

Solving for t, we get:
t = (306 × 18)/(550)
t = 10.08 seconds

Rounding it to the nearest whole number, the time taken for the trains to cross each other is approximately 10 seconds.

Therefore, the answer is (D) 10 seconds.

3. Let's assume the speeds of the trains are x m/s and y m/s, and the length of the platform is P meters.

When the trains run in opposite directions:
Relative speed = x + y m/s
Distance = length of train 1 + length of train 2 + length of platform = 36 + 26 + P meters
Time = 30 seconds

Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time,
36 + 26 + P = (x + y) × 30    ---(1)

When the trains cross each other:
Relative speed = x + y m/s
Distance = length of train

 1 + length of train 2 = 36 + 26 = 62 meters
Time = 30 seconds

Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time,
62 = (x + y) × 30    ---(2)

Dividing equation (1) by equation (2):
(36 + 26 + P)/62 = (x + y) × 30/(x + y) × 30
(36 + 26 + P)/62 = 1

Simplifying,
62 + P = 62
P = 0

The length of the platform is 0 meters, which doesn't make sense. It seems there might be an error in the problem statement or calculations.

Therefore, the ratio of their speeds cannot be determined with the given information.

The answer is None.

4. To find the time taken to cross the platform, we need to calculate the speed of the train first.

The speed of the train = distance/time
Given that the length of the train is 240 meters and it crosses a pole in 12 seconds, we can calculate the speed:

Speed = 240/12 = 20 m/s

Now, we need to find the time taken to cross a platform of length 400 meters.

The distance to be covered is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the platform: 240 + 400 = 640 meters

Using the formula: Time = Distance/Speed,
Time = 640/20 = 32 seconds

Therefore, the train will cross the platform in 32 seconds.

The answer is (None of the above).

5. Let's assume the length of the train is L meters and the length of the platform is P meters.

Given:
Speed of the train = 108 km/hr = (108 × 5/18) m/s = 30 m/s
Speed of the man = 12 km/hr = (12 × 5/18) m/s = 10/3 m/s

When the train crosses the platform:
Distance = length of train + length of platform = L + P meters
Time = 30 seconds

Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time,
L + P = 30 × 30    ---(1)

When the train crosses the man:
Relative speed = train speed - man speed = 30 - 10/3 = (80/3) m/s
Distance = length of train = L meters
Time = 9 seconds

Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time,
L = (80/3) × 9    ---(2)

Dividing equation (2) by equation (1):
L/30 = (80/3) × 9/900
L = (80/3) × 9 × 30/900
L = 80/3

Substituting the value of L in equation (1):
80/3 + P = 30 × 30
P = 900 - 80/3
P = 740/3

Therefore, the length of the train is 80/3 meters and the length of the platform is 740/3 meters.

The answer is (None of the above).

6. Let's assume the distance between the two stations is D km.

Given:
Speed of the first train = 40 km/hr = (40 × 5/18) m/s = 100/9 m/s
Speed of the second train = 45 km/hr = (45 × 5/18) m/s = 25/2 m/s

When the trains meet, the second train from station Q has covered 20 km more distance than the first train from station P.

Let the distance covered by the first train

 from station P be X km.
Then, the distance covered by the second train from station Q = (X + 20) km.

Using the formula: Time = Distance/Speed,
Time taken by the first train = X/(100/9) = 9X/100
Time taken by the second train = (X + 20)/(25/2) = 2(X + 20)/25

Since they meet at the same time, their time taken will be equal:
9X/100 = 2(X + 20)/25

Solving for X, we get:
225X = 200(X + 20)
225X = 200X + 4000
25X = 4000
X = 160

The distance between the two stations (D) is equal to the distance covered by the first train (X) plus the 20 km extra covered by the second train:
D = X + 20 = 160 + 20 = 180 km

Therefore, the distance between the two stations is 180 km.

The answer is (C) 340 km.

7. Let's assume the speeds of the trains are x m/s and y m/s.

When the trains cross a man standing on the platform:
Relative speed = x + y m/s
Time = 28 seconds

Using the formula: Speed = Distance/Time,
Speed of the first train = Distance/28 = D/28 meters/second

When the trains cross each other:
Relative speed = x + y m/s
Time = 26 seconds

Using the formula: Speed = Distance/Time,
Speed of the first train = Distance/26 = D/26 meters/second

Since the distances covered in both cases are the same, we have:
D/28 = D/26

Solving for D, we get:
26D = 28D
2D = 0

The distance cannot be 0, which means there might be an error in the problem statement or calculations.

Therefore, the ratio of their speeds cannot be determined with the given information.

The answer is None.

8. Let's assume the speeds of the trains are x km/hr and y km/hr.

Given:
Time taken by the first train = 9 hours
Time taken by the second train = 16 hours

Let the distances traveled by the first and second trains be D1 km and D2 km, respectively.

Using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time,
D1 = x × 9
D2 = y × 16

The ratio of their speeds is:
x/y = D1/D2 = (x × 9)/(y × 16)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
16x = 9y

Therefore, the ratio of their speeds is 16:9.

The answer is (D) 9:16.

9. Let's assume the speed of the train is x km/hr.

Given:
Distance covered to cross a telegraph post = 264 meters
Time taken = 8 seconds

Using the formula: Speed = Distance/Time,
x = 264/8 = 33 meters/second

Converting the speed to km/hr:
x = 33 × 18/5 = 118.8 km/hr

Therefore, the speed of the train is approximately 118.8 km/hr.

The answer is (None of the above).

10. Let's assume the length of each train is L meters.

Given:
The first train crosses a pole in 18 seconds.
The second train crosses a pole in 12 seconds.

Using the formula: Speed = Distance/Time,
Speed of the first train = L/18 m/s
Speed of the second train = L/

12 m/s

Given that the second train is 50% faster than the first train, we can write the equation:

Speed of the second train = 1.5 × Speed of the first train
L/12 = 1.5 × (L/18)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
L/12 = L/12

The equation holds true for any length of the train (L).

Therefore, the length of the train cannot be determined with the given information.

The answer is (None of the above).
